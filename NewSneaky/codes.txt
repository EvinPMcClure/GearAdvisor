Coolant Temperature:
"P0116": "Engine Coolant Temperature Circuit Range/Performance"
"P2183": "Engine Coolant Temperature Sensor 2 Circuit Range/Performance"
"P2557": "Engine Coolant Level Sensor/Switch Circuit Range/Performance"

"P0181": "Fuel Temperature Sensor A Circuit Range/Performance"
"P0186": "Fuel Temperature Sensor B Circuit Range/Performance"

Vehicle Speed:
"P0501": "Vehicle Speed Sensor 'A' Range/Performance"
"P2159": "Vehicle Speed Sensor 'B' Range/Performance"

MAF:
"P0101": "Mass or Volume Air Flow Circuit Range/Performance"

RPM:
"P0726": "Engine Speed Input Circuit Range/Performance",

Each gear will have its own constant. Determine this constant by speed/RPM
or maybe this: "P0915": "Gear Shift Position Circuit Range/Performance"

May use this:
"P0177": "Fuel Composition Sensor Circuit Range/Performance",
